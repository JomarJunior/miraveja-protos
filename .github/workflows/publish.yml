jobs:
  # Build Job: Creates distribution packages (.tar.gz and .whl) from source code.
  # Rationale:
  #   - Separates build from publish for better security and reusability
  #   - Built artifacts are shared across all publish jobs via GitHub artifacts
  #   - Ensures consistent packages across TestPyPI, PyPI, and GitHub releases
  #   - Single source of truth: build once, publish multiple times
  #   - Fails fast if build has issues before attempting any publishes

  # Publish to TestPyPI Job: Uploads package to PyPI's testing instance.
  # Rationale:
  #   - Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch) - prevents accidental publishes
  #   - Allows testing package installation and metadata before production
  #   - Uses skip-existing to allow multiple test uploads without errors
  #   - Validates trusted publishing configuration before PyPI deployment
  #   - Isolated from production - failures here don't affect real releases
  #   - Useful for verifying README rendering, dependencies, and install process

  # Publish to PyPI Job: Uploads package to production PyPI index.
  # Rationale:
  #   - Dual trigger: automatic on GitHub releases OR manual via workflow_dispatch
  #   - Automatic releases ensure version tags match published versions
  #   - Manual trigger provides emergency hotfix capability if needed
  #   - Uses trusted publishing (OIDC) - no API tokens, more secure
  #   - Environment protection ensures only approved publishes reach production
  #   - Once published, versions are immutable (cannot be overwritten)
  #   - Makes package publicly available via `pip install miraveja-protos`
